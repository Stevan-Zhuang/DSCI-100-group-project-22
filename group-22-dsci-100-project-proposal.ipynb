Accurate diagnosis in the early stage is crucial to effectively treat and prevent possible heart disease. The question we ask is: Using a patientâ€™s age, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and maximum heart rate achieved, how well can we predict the presence of heart disease using a K-nearest neighbors classifier? Our dataset is the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle, which is a combination of five different datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository heart disease index, using 11 common features and one common label. These variables are *Age* for age in years, *Sex* for gender, *ChestPainType* for the type of angina, *RestingBP* for resting blood pressure, *Cholesterol* for serum cholesterol levels in blood, FastingBS for fasting blood sugar, *RestingECG* for resting electrocardiogram results, *MaxHR* for maximum heart rate achieved, *ExerciseAngina* for the angina is exercise-induced, *OldPeak* for ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, *ST_Slope* for the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and *HeartDisease* for the presence of heart disease."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Methods and Results"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The dataset contains general information for patients, as well as information about or related to the heart.
